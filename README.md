🌟 Day 6: Solving Array Problems on LeetCode 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋 I'm excited to share the progress I made on Day 6 of my 50-day LeetCode milestone challenge. Today, I tackled an interesting easy and medium level problem that helped deepen my understanding of array manipulation and problem-solving techniques. Below are the details of what I tackled on Day 6.

Contents:
1. Q442. Find All Duplicates in an Array
    - Problem Statement: Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears once or twice. Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.
    - Time Complexity: O(n) ⏳
    - Approach:
        - **Negation Technique:** As we traverse the array, we use the absolute value of each number to index into the array and negate the number at that index. If we encounter a number that has already been negated, it indicates a duplicate.

Why This Matters:
Practicing these types of problems on LeetCode helps in developing a deeper understanding of essential algorithms and data structures, which is crucial for acing technical interviews and improving coding skills.

Repository Structure:
- `find_all_duplicates.cpp`: Contains the code for solving Q442. Find All Duplicates in an Array using the negation technique.
- `README.md`: This readme file explaining the purpose and usage of the code files.

How to Use:
- Explore the code examples in the respective files to understand the approaches used to solve these problems.
- Use these examples as a reference for your own projects and studies.
